== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The custom admin menu has stuffed my site how can I get it back to normal =
We don't foresee such an event occuring but if you do happen to run into this you can visit: yourwebsite.com/index.php?wp-custom-admin-interface=delete-menu (replacing yourwebsite.com with your website) and this will delete all the options associated with the custom admin menu. You need to make sure you are still logged in to an admin account for this to work. If you don't have admin access you'll need to either remove the database option or delete the plugin entirely. 

= Is WP Custom Admin Interface completely free =
Yes! But for even more possibilities we recommend checking out the pro version: https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/custom-admin-interface-pro/

= Need further help? =
Please use the support forum to raise any issues or questions.

* NOTICE! PLEASE READ! This version of the plugin is a breaking update of the plugin. If you update to this version of the plugin your existing settings will be lost and you'll need to re-enter the settings again. If you are new to the plugin there's nothing to be converned about. Let me explain what's going on. This plugin started small with a couple of nice features. But the single plugin settings page had become so large and complex that the loading time took a significant strain on low-medium powered websites. I needed to take the inevitable action of splitting up the settings into separate pages so the loading time was far more efficient and the plugin was actually usable. I know this is going to be a real pain for existing users but I tried everything to prevent your existing settings from being lost however I couldn't find a good solution to resolve this. On the bright side this new settings platform will enable more advanced exporting and importing of settings which is really valuable to website administrators. In this version you can selectively export and delete specific settings and this is something that wouldn't have been achievable with the older approach to the settings.
